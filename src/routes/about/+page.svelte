        Welcome to Larry Stokes Photography, where every moment tells a story worth preserving. Based in the Greater Pittsburgh Area, I specialize in capturing the authentic emotions and genuine connections that make your special occasions unforgettable.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        With years of experience in wedding, sports, and freelance photography, I bring a passionate and professional approach to every shoot. Whether it's the intimate exchange of vows, the intensity of a game-winning play, or the joy of a family portrait, I'm dedicated to creating images that you'll treasure for a lifetime.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        My photography style focuses on natural, candid moments while ensuring every important detail is beautifully documented. I believe that the best photographs happen when people feel comfortable and can simply be themselves.
      </p>

      <p class="text-[var(--muted)]">
        Let's work together to create something beautiful. I'd love to hear about your vision and help bring it to life through photography.

      <p class="mb-6">
        Photography has been my passion for as long as I can remember. Over the past 35 years, I've had the privilege of capturing life's most unforgettable moments. No matter the setting, I believe every moment has a story to tell.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        I focus on capturing the perfect blend of energy and emotion. Whether it's the split-second action of a winning play or the quiet glance between newlyweds, the small details that make each story unique. My goal is always the same: to create images that are authentic, timeless, and full of life.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        Over the years, I've worked with athletes at every level, couples celebrating their love, and clients with diverse creative visions. Whether I'm on the sidelines, at the altar, or behind the scenes, I strive to bring both technical skill and a creative eye to every project, delivering photographs that not only look great, but truly capture the essence of the moment.
      </p>

      <p class="text-[var(--muted)]">
        If you're looking for someone who can capture the energy, emotion, and essence of your moment, I'd love to work with you.
