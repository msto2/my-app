      <p class="mb-6">
        Welcome to Larry Stokes Photography! Based in the Greater Pittsburgh Area, I've spent more than 35 years doing what I love most: capturing moments that tell a story. From the adrenaline of a game-winning play to a quiet glance between newlyweds, I believe every moment holds something worth remembering.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        I specialize in weddings, sports, and freelance photography, bringing a passionate yet relaxed approach to every shoot. My style leans toward natural, candid moments, the kind that show genuine emotion, while making sure all the important details are beautifully documented.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with athletes at every level, couples celebrating their love, and clients with unique creative visions. Whether I'm on the sidelines, at the altar, or behind the scenes, my goal is always the same: to create images that are authentic, timeless, and full of life.
      </p>

      <p class="text-[var(--muted)]">
        If you're looking for someone who can capture both the energy and the emotion of your story, I'd love to hear your vision and help bring it to life.
